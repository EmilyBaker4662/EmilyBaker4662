## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my repository! This project showcases my work as a game developer creating engaging 2D and 3D games using Unity and C#. It reflects my focus on writing clean, scalable game logic, leveraging Unityâ€™s physics engines, and applying performance optimizations to deliver smooth and immersive gameplay experiences.

At the core of this project is well-structured game logic built with object-oriented C#. I follow best practices for organizing scripts, managing game states, and handling player input to ensure each gameplay system is modular and easy to extend. From player movement and AI behaviors to inventory systems and level mechanics, each component is designed with clarity and reusability in mind.

This repository also makes extensive use of Unityâ€™s powerful 2D and 3D physics engines. Physics-based interactions, including collision detection, rigidbody dynamics, and raycasting, are implemented to create realistic movement and environmental feedback. In 3D games, I incorporate Unityâ€™s character controller and navmesh systems for advanced navigation and interaction.

Performance is a key focus throughout the project. I use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks and apply techniques like object pooling, framerate-independent movement, and efficient update cycles to minimize CPU and GPU overhead. Scene loading and asset management are also optimized to reduce memory usage and ensure fast, responsive gameplay.

Whether youâ€™re a fellow developer exploring Unityâ€™s capabilities or someone looking for structured, production-ready examples, this repository offers a deep dive into the technical side of modern game development. Feel free to explore the code, test the builds, or use it as a foundation for your own projects.
